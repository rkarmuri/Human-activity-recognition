Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone

Problem description: 
There is a lot of demand for understanding human activities in health-care domain, especially in elder care support, rehabilitation assistance, diabetes, and cognitive disorders. We can save a huge number of resources if sensors can help caretakers record and monitor the patients all the time and report automatically when any abnormal behavior is detected. In this project we will learn how to build a classification model that will try to predict what physical activity, like running, walking, cycling along with many other activities the user is doing based on a smartphone. The dataset for the project has been captured from a smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope, covering activities like sitting, standing, walking, walking upstairs and downstairs, and laying. Therefore, through testing and comparing different active learning algorithms we design and build an accurate system on smartphone that detects human activities for fitness and health check.
